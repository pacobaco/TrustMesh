# Trust/Fear GIS Engine

A real-time geospatial analysis engine that processes public messages to assess trust, fear, and narrative stress across geographic zones.

It uses Named Entity Recognition (NER), sentiment analysis, and a looter heat model to simulate narrative risk zones. The system tracks trust polarity over time, detects sudden divergence ("polarity gaps") between adjacent areas, and provides real-time zone trust tickers.

---

## 🔧 Features

- Named Entity Recognition (spaCy)
- Sentiment scoring (VADER)
- Looter heat index calculation
- Polarity gap detection between regions
- Real-time trust ticker with timestamp
- GeoJSON-based mesh zone input

📈 Example Output

🛰️ Zone: ZoneA
  Avg Sentiment: 0.45
  Entity Mentions: ['Mayor Lang']
  Timestamped Trust Ticker:
    2025-06-06T16:12:04.102 → Trust: 0.73

Dramatic Polarity Gaps:
  Between ZoneA and ZoneC: gap = 1.30
